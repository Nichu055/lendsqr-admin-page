# React + TypeScript Project

Welcome! This project is built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It uses npm for package management.

## Overview

This app interacts with external APIs to fetch and store data. The main goal is to provide a smooth user experience while keeping the codebase maintainable and scalable.

## How API Data Is Stored

When the app fetches data from an API, it stores the results in React state using hooks like `useState` or `useReducer`. For more complex scenarios, it may use context providers or state management libraries (like Redux).

Example:
- When you fetch user info, itâ€™s stored in a state variable.
- If you refresh the page, the app fetches the data again from the API.

For temporary storage (like caching), the app may use browser storage (localStorage or sessionStorage) to keep data available between sessions.

## APIs Used

The project uses the following APIs:
- **Example API:** [https://api.example.com/users](https://api.example.com/users)  
  Used to fetch user data.
- **Another API:** [https://api.example.com/posts](https://api.example.com/posts)  
  Used to fetch posts.

You can find the API calls in the codebase, typically inside files like `src/api/` or within React components using `fetch` or `axios`.

## How It Works

1. The app sends a request to the API endpoint.
2. The response is parsed and stored in React state.
3. Components read from state and display the data.
4. If needed, data is cached in localStorage for faster reloads.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
